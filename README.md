#### Extracting join conditions from the body of a query
This is done in my QueryPlan class, specifically in the groupComparisonAtoms method.
In order to explain my way of extracting join conditions i will first go through an example:

We must construct a left deep plan.
So for the CQ: Q(w,x,y,z) :- A(w), B(x), C(y), D(z)
We must first join A and B. Then we join this result with C, then we join this result with D.
So the first join concerns A and B (lets call it AB). The second join Concerns AB and C (lets call it ABC). The third and final join concerns ABC and D.

As mentioned in my JavaDocs, we keep track of which relational atom (RA) number each variable belongs to.
In the CQ: Q(w,x,y,z) :- A(w), B(x), C(y), D(z).
The variable w belongs to relational atom 0, x belongs to 1, y belongs to 2 and z belongs to 3.

Now imagine we have the following added comparison atoms:
CQ: Q(w,x,y,z) :- A(w), B(x), C(y), D(z), w=x, x=z.
Each of the comparison atoms above are join conditions.
For example, w=x is a join condition because w belongs to RA number 0 abd x belongs to RA number 1, and 0!=1.
If the lhs and rhs belonged to the same RA number, then it would be a selection condition.
If the lhs or rhs was a constant, this would also be a selection condition.

I will now explain how i assign join conditions.
When i say that a join condition belongs to a relational atom, i mean that the join is between that relational atom and the 
previous relational atom (which may already be joined).
For instance in CQ: Q(w,x,y,z) :- A(w), B(x), C(y), D(z), w=x, x=y.
We assign the join condition x=y to the relational atom C because it is the join condition for AB and C.
The way i work this out is by choosing the maximum of the 2 RA numbers.
For instance in x=y, with RA number of x being 1 and RA number of y being 2, since y's RA number is greater than x's RA number (2>1), we assign the 
join condition to y's relational atom.

So in the CQ: Q(w,x,y,z) :- A(w), B(x), C(y), D(z), w=x, x=z.
The join condition w=x is assigned to RA number 1; the join condition is between A and B.
The join condition x=z is assigned to the RA number 3; the join condition is between ABC and D.

Note that in CQ: Q(w,x,y,z) :- A(w), B(x), C(y), D(z), w=x, x=z. There is no join condition between AB and C, so this ends up being a cartesian product.
